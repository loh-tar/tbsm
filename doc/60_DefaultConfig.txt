Default Configuration
=======================
This file is written with blood, sweat and tears only for your convenience and
lists the hard coded defaults with some comments.

You can use this file as inspiration or starting point for your customization.
Create a tbsm.conf file with portions out of this file or extract all of it as
blue print e.g. by running one of these commands:

For your personal config:
  $ tbsm doc conf|sed -n "/^# ~COMPLETE~/,/^*$/p" >~/.config/tbsm/tbsm.conf

To only extract some SUGGESTIONS use it instead of COMPLETE in the command.
  $ tbsm doc conf|sed -n "/^# ~SUGGESTIONS~/,/^*$/p" >~/.config/tbsm/tbsm.conf

After that, edit the new file as you like to gain some effect. If you think it
should fit as system wide file, move it to /etc/xdg/tbsm/tbsm.conf.

As ever, these are the usual paths, adjust them to fit your system.

HINT: We don't ship a config file in the system config directory to avoid
trouble in case of an update.
